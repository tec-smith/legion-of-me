# Legion of Me

Put simply, here is an application that enables one to quickly accomplish a variety of tasks! As always, the code is well documented and demonstration may be found through visiting [the actual website...](https://legionof.me) However, some features will only be accesible through subscription. Hence this repository holds only the concept code and not a complete base, but this will evolve through time as premium features are released for public use.

# Contribute

This project is a great starting point and something I hope is quite understandable through the eloquent Typescript programming. It would be amazing if you would like to contribute to the code, open a pull request! Alternatively, if you would like to [buy me a cup of tea](https://buymeacoffee.com/tecsmith) it would be most appreciated!
